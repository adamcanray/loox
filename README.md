# Loox

Investigate the port for each host on your current network.

## Getting Started

To run the `loox.sh` file, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/adamcanray/loox.git`.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository using `cd loox`.

3. Run the `loox.sh` file with the `-tlip` option and the IP range you want to scan. For example, to scan the `192.168.1.100/24` network, run:

   ```
   ./loox.sh -tlip=192.168.1.100/24
   ```

   This will scan all hosts on the `192.168.1` network.
